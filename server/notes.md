This server folder is for working with back end stuffs

The 'package.json' file is created using the cmd "npm init -y"

If you want to run a server with a custom command:
- go to package.json file
- under scripts, write this: <code> "start": "nodemon index.js" </code>
- so in the cmd, you can write "start" instead of "nodemon index" to run a server
